# iOS UI Design

The goal of this class will not be to build whole applications. instead the
focus will be digging into UIView and all of the UI elements built from UIView
to get a deeper understanding into how they work. Then to apply these ideas
to build new custom UI elements.

The end product of the class will be a library of UI elements that improve on
and customize the existing UI elements, and building new UI elements from
scratch.

Class projects will include the creation of a Make School set of UI elements.
Students will all contribute to the library using Github. To goal for each
student is to provide at least on new and unique UI element to the library.

## Goals

- Use CGRect and it's methods to build custom UI controls from Views
- Build flexible UI controls using Subclasses while exploring initializers
- Modify and architect UI elements that are flexible using: @IBDesignable and
@IBInspectible

## Progress

Progress in the class at your own pace. Be sure to look at each lesson. The
material looks new or you feel it would be good to review, then follow the
lesson from beginning to end.

If you feel you understand the material in a lesson skip to the Challenges. Use
the challenges as a **check for understanding**. You can be sure that you
understand the material if you can complete the challenges.

_You can also look at the challenges as interview questions you might be asked._

When you feel you understand the material from one lesson move on to the next.

If you see an opportunity to create an interesting or useful class that can be
contributed to the Make School UI Library feel free to stop and develop that
further. 

## Lessons

- UIView : UIView is the base class for all visual elements. It defines a
rectangular area of the screen in which you can draw anything.
  - [00-uiview](00-uiview)
- Subclassing UIView : To make your own UI elements you will create subclasses
of UIView.
  - [01-subclass-uiview](01-subclass-uiview)
