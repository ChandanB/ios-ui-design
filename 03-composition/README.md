# Composition vs Inheritance

When one object owns another object we call it composition. When a class
declares another class as it's super class we call that inheritance.

These are two methods you will use to built more complex systems from smaller
less complex systems.

Each of these two has it's place. Inheritance tends to sound like the right
way to do things. Object oriented programming is built on inheritance.

In practice composition is easier and more flexible.

Composition is simple (See the talk Simple vs Easy). Any time an object holds
another object in a property this is composition.
