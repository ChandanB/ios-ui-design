# iOS UI Design

The goal of this class will not be to build whole applications. instead the
focus will be digging into UIView and all of the UI elements built from UIView
to get a deeper understanding into how they work. Then to apply these ideas
to build new custom UI elements.

The end product of the class will be a library of UI elements that improve on
and customize the existing UI elements, and building new UI elements from
scratch.

Class projects will include the creation of a Make School set of UI elements.
Students will all contribute to the library using Github. To goal for each
student is to provide at least on new and unique UI element to the library.

## Goals

- Use CGRect and it's methods to build custom UI controls from Views
- Build flexible UI controls using Subclasses while exploring initializers
- Modify and architect UI elements that are flexible using: @IBDesignable and
@IBInspectible
