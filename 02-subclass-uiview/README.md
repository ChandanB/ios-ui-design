# Making Views Special

Subclass UIView as SpecialView

- SpecialViews are special because they have a color.
  - Use an init to set the color
  - Use a custom init to add a color when a view is created
  - Use Class properties to get the colors used by SpecialViews

## Using Initializers

Swift supports multiple initializers.

A subclass must call the default initializer in it's super class.

Use initializers to simplify your work and make your subclasses more flexible.
